	•	Proof-of-concept code or screenshots (if available)

What to Expect
	•	We’ll acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
	•	Our team will investigate the issue and provide regular updates (typically every 5–7 business days).
	•	If the vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll aim to deploy a fix as soon as possible and credit your contribution (if desired).
	•	If the report is declined, we’ll explain why and suggest alternative routes for feedback if needed.

Responsible Disclosure

Please avoid:
